MAjor CSR Projects
The future of any community is measured by the value they put on
education. One of DMAC's core CSR commitment is in children education.
We helped in sourcing primary and secondary school textbooks of
Mutimusakwa School in Mhondoro and since then there has been
remarkable improvement in the school results. 
Igniting the Future Through Education
A Commitment to Public Health.
During the peak of the Covid health crisis, DMAC in conjunction with the
Zimbabwe National Army mobilized resources to ensure community
safety through free vaccinations. This image captures our rapid response
effort, providing essential COVID-19 testing and health education
through our mobile Lifestyle Centre. Our CSR vision means standing on
the front lines, actively supporting the resilience and well-being of the
people we serve. Health is not a privilege; it is our priority.

Honoring our Heroes
Between the period 2019 to 2021, human remains of our ex-freedom
fighters were found in a disused shaft in the Odzi area of Mutare. Working
with all the different arms of government,  DMAC spearheaded the
exhumation and reburial of 120 bodies of our ex freedom fighters. The
whole exercise was done at a cost of US$350,000 which was fully funded
by DMAC Zimbabwe Pvt Limited.
